## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
  Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable instead
  of declaring separate variables for each value.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
  The array variable gets declared and is followed by the assignment
  operator. This is followed by brackets and inside of the brackets
  are the elements associated with the array. The brackets are then
  closed and ended with a semicolon.
- What number represents the **first** index of an array?
  The number that represents the "first" index is zero.
- How can you access the last element of an array?
  You can access the last element by using the syntax:
    const lastArrayElement = array[array.length - 1];
    console.log(lastArrayElement);
